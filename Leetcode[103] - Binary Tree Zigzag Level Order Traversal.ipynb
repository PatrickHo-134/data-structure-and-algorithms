    "Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: [[1]]\n",

    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an empty list `ans` to store the zigzag level order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check if the input `root` is `None`. If it is, return the empty `ans` list as there are no nodes to traverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Initialize a queue using `deque` and add the `root` node to it. This queue will help in level order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Maintain a flag `left` to determine the direction of the zigzag. Initialize it to 1 which represents left to right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Enter a while loop that will run as long as there are nodes left in the queue:\n",
    "    - Create a temporary list `t` to store the values of nodes at the current level.\n",
    "    - Within the while loop, run another for loop that fetches each node of the current level from the queue:\n",
    "        + Pop nodes from the left side of the queue (`popleft`) and append their value to `t`.\n",
    "        + Add the left and right children of these nodes to the queue if they exist.\n",
    "    - After the for loop, check the `left` flag. If it indicates right to left order (flag is 0), reverse the list `t`.\n",
    "    - Append the list `t`, which represents the values at current level, to ans.\n",
    "    - Toggle the `left` flag using bitwise `XOR` (left ^= 1) to switch the direction for the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After the traversal is done and all levels are processed, return the ans list containing the zigzag level order traversal.\n"

    "## Solution Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is implemented using the **breadth-first search (BFS)** algorithm, which is ideal for level order traversal in trees. BFS is typically implemented with a queue data structure that stores nodes at each level of the tree. Additionally, the solution employs a simple flag toggling mechanism to keep track of the zigzag pattern requirement and a deque structure from Python's collections module for efficient popping from both ends of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step walk-through of the code corresponding to the BFS algorithm and the modifications made to achieve zigzag level order traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Solution class contains the zigzagLevelOrder method, which takes 'root' of the binary tree as an input and returns a list of lists of integers representing the zigzag level order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An empty list `ans` is initialized to store the final zigzag traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A check for the base case is performed where if 'root' is `None`, the method immediately returns the empty `ans` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A `deque` is initialized with the 'root' node. This queue (q) will be used for the BFS traversal, storing the nodes at each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `left` flag is initialized to 1, representing the initial direction of traversal from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A while loop begins, which keeps running as long as there are nodes in the queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A temporary list `t` is created to store the nodes' values at the current level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A for loop iterates over the current level's nodes present in the queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "        + The method `popleft` is used to pop nodes from the left side of the queue to ensure FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "        + The value of the node is added to the temporary list `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        + The node's left and right children are added to the queue if they are not `None`. This step ensures that the next level's nodes are added to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Once all nodes from the current level have been processed, a check is made for the `left` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "        + If `left` is `0`, indicating that the current level should be traversed from right to left, the list `t` is reversed before being appended to `ans`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        + If `left` is `1`, list `t` is appended to `ans` as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The `left` flag is toggled using bitwise XOR (`left ^= 1`) to reverse the direction for the next level's traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. After all levels have been processed and the queue is empty, the while loop exits, and the method returns the `ans` list, which now contains the zigzag level order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to this solution is the combination of a typical BFS with the dynamic reversal of the levels' node values based on the `left` flag, which indicates the directive of traversal. The `deque` allows for efficient addition and removal of nodes during traversal, and toggling of `left` at each level effortlessly manages the zigzag pattern without any complex conditions or additional data structures."
